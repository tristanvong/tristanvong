# Hello, I'm Tristan

## About Me
I'm currently a student at Erasmushogeschool Brussel studying Applied Computer Science. Check out my website: [tristanvong.be](https://tristanvong.be)

## Projects I'm Proud Of
- **[BXL Project: Internaat Woluwe](https://github.com/WoutDepeuter/internaat-bxl-project)**: This Expo (TypeScript / React Native) project was given to us by a boarding school in Brussels. Wout and I wanted to do something that would have a positive impact on the community, so we asked around and offered our help voluntarily. Our task was to transform their existing website into a mobile application.
- **[InternQuest](https://github.com/tristanvong/InternQuest)**: This Spring powered project aims to make it more fun for students to find an internship just like in a quest in a game. I made this because I think finding an internship is difficult and needs some motivation I believe this small project could help people with that issue.
- **[Cookingz](https://github.com/tristanvong/Cookingz)**: This Laravel powered project is a community-driven website on which users are able to share their favorite recipes, making it easy for anyone to discover new recipes with ease. I like cooking from time to time and this is why I made it.
- **[BestCat4U](https://github.com/tristanvong/WebAdvanced)**: Even though this is not my best work, I really liked working on this project because I really like cats. I might remake this during the summer break.

## Projects I stand behind and support
- **[Snowflake ❄️ Project by Tor](https://snowflake.torproject.org/)**: "Snowflake is a system that **allows people from all over the world to access censored websites and applications**. Similar to how VPNs assist users in getting around Internet censorship, Snowflake helps you avoid being noticed by Internet censors by making your Internet activity appear as though you're using the Internet for a regular video or voice call."
