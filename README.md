# Hello, I'm Tristan
## About Me
I'm currently a student at Erasmushogeschool Brussel studying Applied Computer Science.

## Projects I'm Proud Of
- **[InternQuest](https://github.com/tristanvong/InternQuest)**: This Spring powered project aims to make it more fun for students to find an internship just like in a quest in a game. I made this because I think finding an internship is difficult and needs some motivation I believe this small project could help people with that issue.
- **[Cookingz](https://github.com/tristanvong/Cookingz)**: This Laravel powered project is a community-driven website on which users are able to share their favorite recipes, making it easy for anyone to discover new recipes with ease. I like cooking from time to time and this is why I made it.
- **[BestCat4U](https://github.com/tristanvong/WebAdvanced)**: Even though this is not my best work, I really liked working on this project because I really like cats. I might remake this during the summer break.
