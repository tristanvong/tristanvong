# Hello, I'm Tristan

I'm currently a student at [Erasmushogeschool Brussel](https://www.erasmushogeschool.be/en) studying Applied Computer Science. Check out my website: [tristanvong.be](https://tristanvong.be)

> [!NOTE]
> I'm planning on remaking some of my old projects in the coming weeks. To implement Docker and change some parts to strive to have better software.

## Some of the projects I made/ am working on
- **[BXL Project: Internaat Woluwe](https://github.com/WoutDepeuter/internaat-bxl-project)**: This Expo (TypeScript / React Native) project was given to us by a boarding school in Brussels. Wout and I wanted to do something that would have a positive impact on the community, so we asked around and offered our help voluntarily. Our task was to transform their existing website into a mobile application.
- **[BestCat4U-Py](https://github.com/tristanvong/BestCat4U-Py)**: A quiz which suggests a cat breed based on your preference, quick and easy to use. This project is a remake of my older (first version): [BestCat4U](https://github.com/tristanvong/BestCat4U)
- **[Cookingz](https://github.com/tristanvong/Cookingz)**: This Laravel powered project is a community-driven website on which users are able to share their favorite recipes, making it easy for anyone to discover new recipes with ease. I like cooking from time to time and this is why I made it.
- **[InternQuest](https://github.com/tristanvong/InternQuest)**: This Spring powered project aims to make it more fun for students to find an internship just like in a quest in a game. I made this because I think finding an internship is difficult and needs some motivation I believe this small project could help people with that issue.

## Projects I like
- **[Snowflake ❄️ Project by Tor](https://snowflake.torproject.org/)**: "Snowflake is a system that **allows people from all over the world to access censored websites and applications**. Similar to how VPNs assist users in getting around Internet censorship, Snowflake helps you avoid being noticed by Internet censors by making your Internet activity appear as though you're using the Internet for a regular video or voice call."
- **[KDE Desktop Environment](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop)**: Since I've started using Linux (openSUSE Tumbleweed) on my laptop I've stuck with KDE because of its simplicity but how extensible it is. I really like it.
- **[Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)**: By far my favourite and most used browser extension.
